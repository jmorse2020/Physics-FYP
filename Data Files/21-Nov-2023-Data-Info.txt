Data information.
Today we had a 57.5cm fibre length (measured with metre rule). it is pcf and we had it going through the original dispersion setup.

Scan-1-poi-vs-stage-pos-LHS: 
We moved the stage (air delay in ref arm) and tracked the movement of the poi. This was for the fringe to the LHS of the 1064nm pump wavelength.

{spectral-interference, fibre-arm, reference-arm}-550-1700nmn-1:
 This data is a scan with both poi's in the spectrum. Not useful for measuring dispersion.


no-poi-{spectral-interference, fibre-arm, reference-arm}-550-1700nmn-1:
 This data is with the poi on the RHS of the pump laser wavelength (1064nm) outside the spectrum, here the stage position was 15.2458mm. Use for dispersion calculation 1.


no-poi-{spectral-interference, fibre-arm, reference-arm}-550-1700nmn-2:
 This data is with the poi on the RHS of the pump laser wavelength (1064nm) outside the spectrum, here the stage position was 15.2635mm. Use for dispersion calculation 2.
